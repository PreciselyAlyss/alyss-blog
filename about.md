Alyss is a developer advocate at a saas platform. She's constantly thinking of ways to redistribute the tribal knowledge of programming and how to create a welcoming environment for new developers. She's often compared, amongst friends, to a combination of GLaDOS and Google Assistant. She's an avid gamer and previously ran tournaments for Riot Games.
